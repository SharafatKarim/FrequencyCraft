Frequency Craft is a web application that allows users to generate frequency distributions and corresponding graphs based on input data. It provides a simple interface to input data, analyze it, and visualize the frequency distribution using various types of charts like bar charts, line charts, pie charts, doughnut charts, polar area charts, and radar charts.

## Features

- Input Data: Users can input their frequency data directly into the web application. The input supports multiple rows of frequency data, making it suitable for analyzing various datasets.

- Frequency Distribution: Frequency Craft calculates the frequency distribution of the input data using the Sturges formula to determine the number of classes. It then displays the frequency distribution table, showing class intervals, frequencies, and cumulative frequencies.

- Graph Generation: Based on the frequency distribution, Frequency Craft generates interactive charts using Chart.js. Users can choose from various chart types like bar charts, line charts, pie charts, doughnut charts, polar area charts, and radar charts to visualize the data.

## Installation
